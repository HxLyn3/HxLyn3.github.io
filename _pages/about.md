<p> Currently, I am a first-year PhD student of School of Artificial Intelligence in <a href="https://www.nju.edu.cn/EN/main.htm">Nanjing University</a> under the supervision of Prof. <a href="http://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn/yuy/">Yang Yu</a> and also a member of <a href="https://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn/MainPage.ashx">LAMDA Group</a>, which is led by Prof. <a href="https://cs.nju.edu.cn/zhouzh/index.htm">Zhi-Hua Zhou</a>.  
Before my Ph.D. research, I received my B.Sc. degree in Telecommunication Engineering in 2021 from <a href="https://www.sysu.edu.cn/sysuen/"> Sun Yat-sen University </a> . In September 2021, I was admitted to study for a M.Sc. degree in <a href="https://www.nju.edu.cn/EN/main.htm">Nanjing University</a>  under the supervision of  Prof. <a href="http://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn/yuy/">Yang Yu</a> without entrance examination. From September 2024, I started studying for PhD degree under the supervision of Prof. <a href="http://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn/yuy/">Yang Yu</a>. 

**Research interest:**  I am interested in handling challenges of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in real-world applications. In particular, I focus my research topics on model-based RL and offline RL. I am also working to develop RL algorithms for robotics.
